I want to improve the quality of education at my school, and I want to analyze which variables are most associated with improved levels of education. By doing this, we can decide where investments in education should be spent.
### Variables of Interest
`Parental Involvement`
`Internet_Access`
`Extracurricular_Activities`
`Hours_Studied`
`Sleep_Hours`
`Attendance`
`Teacher_Quality`


### Outcomes to Analyze
`Previous_Scores`
`Exam_Score`

# Goals and Actions

# Analysis
	•	Python Basics: Variables, loops, conditionals.
	•	Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
	•	Functions: Writing modular code, lambda functions.
	•	File Handling: Reading and writing to CSV and JSON files.
	•	Modules: Using built-in libraries like math and random.
	•	Exploratory Analysis: Summary statistics, identifying patterns.
	•	DataFrames: Creation, manipulation, filtering, and sorting.
	•	Data Aggregation: Grouping and summarizing data.
	•	Time Series: Handling time-indexed data.
	•	Advanced Functions: Using .apply() and lambda functions for efficiency.
	•	Visualizations: Using matplotlib and seaborn for scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
	•	Summary Statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
	•	Identifying Patterns: Correlation matrices and hypothesis testing.
