# Findings



### Associations

There is a very weak association between the previous exam scores and the current exam scores, and the association is even weaker between the difference and the current exam scores. This demonstrates that we shouldn't use the difference in scores as an accurate metric of how the students did because there is a small correlation between recieving a high final exam score and having a big difference in test scores.

* Given these findings, we must use purely the final exam scores to measure student success.
