## About The Project

I am currently conducting an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive data set that examines a variety of factors influencing student performance. Specifically, the level of student performance is quantified through standardized testing scores, which provide a numerical representation of academic achievement. My objective is to thoroughly investigate the various contributing factors that may impact these scores. These factors include, but are not limited to, familial life and its dynamics, the role of extracurricular activities in fostering skills and enhancing engagement, financial stability and its influence on access to resources, as well as other sociocultural elements that may play a pivotal role. By exploring these variables, I aim to uncover insights that could lead to a better understanding of how to support and improve student outcomes effectively.
